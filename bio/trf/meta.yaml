  Wrapper for Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF), a tool to identify tandem repeats in DNA sequences,
  enabling easy integration into Snakemake workflows.

authors:
  - Muhammad Rohan Ali Asmat
input:
  - fasta: A DNA sequence file in FASTA format to be analyzed by Tandem Repeats Finder.
output:
  - dat: "Data file (``*.dat``)."
  - mask: "Masked sequence file (``*.mask``)."
  - html: "HTML file (``*.html``)."
params:
  match: "Match weight (default: 2, allowed: >= 1, )"
  mismatch: "Mismatch penalty (default: 7, allowed: 3, 5, 7)"
  delta: "Indel penalty (default: 7, allowed: 3, 5, 7)"
  pm: "Match probability percentage (default: 80, allowed: 75, 80)"
  pi: "Indel probability percentage (default: 10, allowed: 10, 20)"
  minscore: "Minimum alignment score to report (default: 50, allowed: >=1)"
  maxperiod: "Maximum period size to report (default: 500, allowed: >= 1 and <=2000)"
  extra: "Optional command-line flags to pass to Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF). |nl| These flags are appended after the 7 required numeric parameters. Supported flags (default state in parentheses): -m (generate masked sequence file), -f (include flanking sequence), -d (produce .dat file), -h (suppress HTML output), -l <n> (set max tandem repeat size, default 500, allowed: >=1, preffered: >=1 and <=29), -ngs (more compact .dat output on multisequence files), -u (usage), -v (version). Provide flags as a quoted string, e.g., '-d -h'."
notes: >
  If one or more numeric parameters (e.g., match, mismatch) are not provided,
  the wrapper will automatically substitute the default values recommended by TRF, as listed in the params
  section. |nl| |nl|

  Flags are default to `-m -f -d`, in case the user doesn't specify a flag. Flag(s) are specified using the 'extra' param (e.g., '-d -h'). 
  In case user specifies a flag, then a flag combination with defaults is not formed rather his input of flag(s) is considered. |nl| |nl|

  One or more output type of files are produced based on the flag(s) slection just as in TRF. |nl| |nl|
